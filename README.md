# testCase__SDsolution

The purpose of the application is to allow end-users to quickly enter and manage a list of name/value pairs.

Although this test must be written without any other persons help, any standard reference material that is used during a normal programming cycle may be used (such as online help or books). No third party class libraries or code snippets may be used, except for jQuery.

Create an HTML application using a UI similar to the one shown below. The application code should be written in HTML and JavaScript.

# Required Features:

Name/Value pairs are to be entered into the upper textbox. This textbox will be used by the end-user to quickly add Name/Value pairs to the list below.

When a Name/Value pair is about to be added to the list it must be validated to ensure proper syntax. If the syntax is incorrect then the Name/Value pair must not be added. The Name/Value pair entry format is shown below:
<name> = <value>

Where <name> is the name portion of the pair, and <value> is the value portion of the pair. Only valid Name/Value pairs can be added. Names and Values can contain only alpha-numeric characters. The equal-sign is used to delimit the pair, spaces before and/or after the equal-sign may be entered by the end user (and should be ignored.) 

When the ‘Sort by Name’ button is pressed the list will be sorted ascending by Name.

When the ‘Sort by Value’ button is pressed the list will be sorted ascending by Value.

When the ‘Delete’ button is pressed all selected items in the listbox will be deleted.
